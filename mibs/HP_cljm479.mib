        It is an implementation-specific matter as to

        from the table.  Accordingly, management stations
        must be prepared to receive tabular information

        entries requires examination of the relevant

        printer. The user may have to enter a PIN, provided by the printer,
        if the mobile device requests PIN method.
        Manual - Wi-Fi Direct clients require printer interaction to
        connect. The user has to push a button on the printer or enter a
        PIN into the mobile device to connect depending on the method
        requested by mobile device.
        Advanced  - This mode disables Wi-Fi Direct, switches to Wireless
        Direct and allows configuration of advanced settings.

        DESCRIPTION
        "HP print servers support secured network access via Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
        on an IEEE 802.1X network. The IEEE 802.1X standard provides a port-based authentication protocol
        where a network port allows or blocks use, depending on client authentication results.
        When using an 802.1X connection, the print server supports EAP with an authentication server,
        such as a remote authentication dial-in user service (RADIUS, RFC 2138) server.
        Brief description of few currently supported EAP/802.1X methods:
        1) LEAP (lightweight EAP) is a proprietary Cisco Systems protocol that uses passwords for
        mutual authentication. It is used to authenticate access by a wireless client, typically a Cisco
        Aironet base station.
        2) PEAP (Protected EAP) is a mutual authentication protocol that uses digital certificates
        for network server authentication and passwords for client authentication. For additional
        security, the authentication exchanges are encapsulated within transport layer security (TLS).
        Dynamic encryption keys are used for secure communications.
        3) EAP-TLS (RFC 2716) is a mutual authentication protocol based on X.509v3–compliant digital
        certificates for authentication of both the client and the network authentication server.
        Dynamic encryption keys are used for secure communications.
        The following bitwise values are defined for this OID:
        None(0),
        EAP-MD5(1),
        EAP-TLS(2),
        LEAP(4),

        Used to explicitly configure the TLS ciphers that would be supported by the device.
        This OID is added because the current cipher categorization into LOW-MEDIUM-HIGH is fading away.
        Following are some of the scenarios where explicit configuration of allowed ciphers are required:
        Scenario 1) A customer may need HIGH encryption strength ciphers only, but for interoperability
        they may need to enable specific LOW/MEDIM cipher.
        Eg - RC4 which is a LOW Strength cipher is required for interoperability with Windows when HIGH encryption strength is set.
        Scenario 2) Customers may want to disable specific ciphers as and when security vulnerabilities
        are detected in them.
        The current list of ciphers and their standard Cipher Suite Values:

        MAX-ACCESS read-only
        STATUS     current
        DESCRIPTION
        "Auxiliary information to allow a printing application to use
        the channel for data submission to the printer.  An application
        capable of using a specific PrtChannelType should be able to
        use the combined information from the prtChannelInformation and
        other channel and interface group objects to 'bootstrap' its
        use of the channel.  prtChannelInformation is not intended to
        provide a general channel description, nor to provide
        information that is available once the channel is in use.
        The encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation
        object is specific to channel type.  The description of each
        PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation is
        defined specifies the appropriate encoding and interpretation,
        including interaction with other objects.  For channel types
        that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value
        shall be null (0 length).
        When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its
        accompanying description must specify the encoding and
        interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the
        channel type.  prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing
        PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as
        described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values.
        The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of
        channel attributes, represented as text according to the
        following rules:
        1. The prtChannelInformation is not affected by localization.
        2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing
        the attribute values.  Each entry consists of the following
        items, in order:
        a. A keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z)
        represented by their NVT ASCII [RFC854] codes, that
        identifies a channel attribute,
        b. The NVT ASCII code for an Equals Sign (=) (code 61) to
        delimit the keyword,
        c. A data value encoded using rules specific to the
        PrtChannelType to with the prtChannelInformation applies which
        must in no case allow an octet with value 10 (the NVT ASCII
        Line Feed code),
        d. the NVT ASCII code for a Line Feed character (code 10) to
        delimit the data value.
        No other octets shall be present.
        Keywords are case-sensitive.  Conventionally, keywords are
        capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword) and
        since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are
        kept short.
        3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is
        represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each
        specifying one value. Otherwise, there shall be at most one
        entry for each attribute.
        4. By default, entries may appear in any order.  If there are
        ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be
        specified in their definitions.
        5. The prtChannelInformation value by default consists of text
        represented by NVT ASCII graphics character codes.  However,
        other representations may be specified:
        a. In cases where the prtChannelInformation value contains
        information not normally coded in textual form, whatever
        symbolic representation is conventionally used for the
        information should be used for encoding the
        prtChannelInformation value.  (For instance, a binary port value
        might be represented as a decimal number using NVT ASCII
        codes.)  Such encoding must be specified in the definition of
        the value.
        b. The value may contain textual information in a character set
        other than NVT ASCII graphics characters.  (For instance, an
        identifier might consist of ISO 10646 text encoded using the
        UTF-8 encoding scheme.)  Such a character set and its encoding
        must be specified in the definition of the value.
        6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation
        entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the
        PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following
        information for each entry:
        Title:        Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port name',
        'Service Name', etc.
        Keyword:      The keyword value, e.g.: 'Port' or 'Service'
        Syntax:       The encoding of the entry value if it cannot be
        directly represented by NVT ASCII.
        Status:       'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally
        Mandatory'
        Multiplicity: 'Single' or 'Multiple' to indicate whether the
        entry may be present multiple times.
        Description:  Description of the use of the entry, other
        information required to complete the definition
        (e.g.: ordering constraints, interactions between
        entries).
        Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore
        unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry
        types are added."

        of this user to/from the SNMP engine identified by
        usmUserEngineID, to be modified via a one-way
        function.
        The associated protocol is the usmUserAuthProtocol.
        The associated secret key is the user's secret
        authentication key (authKey). The associated hash
        algorithm is the algorithm used by the user's
        usmUserAuthProtocol.
        When creating a new user, it is an 'inconsistentName'
        error for a set operation to refer to this object
        unless it is previously or concurrently initialized
        through a set operation on the corresponding instance
        of usmUserCloneFrom.
        When the value of the corresponding usmUserAuthProtocol
        is usmNoAuthProtocol, then a set is successful, but
        effectively is a no-op.
        When this object is read, the zero-length (empty)
        string is returned.
        The recommended way to do a key change is as follows:
        1) GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
        2) generate the keyChange value based on the old
        (existing) secret key and the new secret key,
        let us call this kcValue.
        If you do the key change on behalf of another user:
        3) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
        usmUserAuthKeyChange=kcValue
        usmUserPublic=randomValue)
        If you do the key change for yourself:
        4) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue,
        usmUserOwnAuthKeyChange=kcValue
        usmUserPublic=randomValue)
        If you get a response with error-status of noError,
        then the SET succeeded and the new key is active.
        If you do not get a response, then you can issue a
        GET(usmUserPublic) and check if the value is equal
        to the randomValue you did send in the SET. If so, then
        the key change succeeded and the new key is active
        (probably the response got lost). If not, then the SET
        request probably never reached the target and so you
        can start over with the procedure above.

        the type of authentication protocol which is used.
        An instance of this object is created concurrently
        with the creation of any other object instance for
        the same user (i.e., as part of the processing of
        the set operation which creates the first object
        instance in the same conceptual row).
        If an initial set operation (i.e. at row creation time)
        tries to set a value for an unknown or unsupported
        protocol, then a 'wrongValue' error must be returned.
        The value will be overwritten/set when a set operation
        is performed on the corresponding instance of
        usmUserCloneFrom.
        Once instantiated, the value of such an instance of
        this object can only be changed via a set operation to
        the value of the usmNoAuthProtocol.
        If a set operation tries to change the value of an
        existing instance of this object to any value other
        than usmNoAuthProtocol, then an 'inconsistentValue'
        error must be returned.
        If a set operation tries to set the value to the
        usmNoAuthProtocol while the usmUserPrivProtocol value
        in the same row is not equal to usmNoPrivProtocol,
        then an 'inconsistentValue' error must be returned.
        That means that an SNMP command generator application
        must first ensure that the usmUserPrivProtocol is set
        to the usmNoPrivProtocol value before it can set
        the usmUserAuthProtocol value to usmNoAuthProtocol.

        DESCRIPTION "A pointer to another conceptual row in this
        usmUserTable.  The user in this other conceptual
        row is called the clone-from user.
        When a new user is created (i.e., a new conceptual
        row is instantiated in this table), the privacy and
        authentication parameters of the new user must be
        cloned from its clone-from user. These parameters are:
        - authentication protocol (usmUserAuthProtocol)
        - privacy protocol (usmUserPrivProtocol)
        They will be copied regardless of what the current
        value is.
        Cloning also causes the initial values of the secret
        authentication key (authKey) and the secret encryption
        key (privKey) of the new user to be set to the same
        values as the corresponding secrets of the clone-from
        user to allow the KeyChange process to occur as
        required during user creation.
        The first time an instance of this object is set by
        a management operation (either at or after its
        instantiation), the cloning process is invoked.
        Subsequent writes are successful but invoke no
        action to be taken by the receiver.
        The cloning process fails with an 'inconsistentName'
        error if the conceptual row representing the
        clone-from user does not exist or is not in an active
        state when the cloning process is invoked.

        octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
        sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.
        Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not

        subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding
